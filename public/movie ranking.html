<h2>Only the most exquisite taste</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Hitman's Bodyguard</h3>

<p>- This has to be one of the funniest moveies I have ever seen. <br>
    No matter how many times I watch it, I still get a kick out of it.</p>

<h3>The Proposal</h3>

<p>- Needless to say I am a fan of Ryan Reynolds. However, I am <br /> also 
    a fan of Sandra Bullock so this movie is amazing.</p>

<h3>One Punch Man</h3>

<p>- When it comes to anime, this is one of the greatest works of art. <br />
Fantastic animation and a story that makes this show timeless.</p>
